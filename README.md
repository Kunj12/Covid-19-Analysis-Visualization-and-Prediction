# Covid-19-Analysis-Visualization-and-Prediction
In this Mini project i will first analyze and visualize the existing data for covid-19 and then using the Prophet library will Predict the (future) for the Positive Cases , Death Toll, Recovered Cases
I have Uploaded both jupyter notebook file in the name of miniprojectbook.ipynb and also .py file in miniproject folder
I have uploaded the notebook without the output because of the longer output it may can get messy so you can always install the mentioned libraries and run the notebook for the output

My Data set was upto 29/05/2021
