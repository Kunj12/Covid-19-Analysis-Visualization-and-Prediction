# Covid-19-Analysis-Visualization-and-Prediction
In this Mini project i will first analyze and visualize the existing data for covid-19 and then using the Prophet library will Predict the (future) for the Positive Cases , Death Toll, Recovered Cases
I have Uploaded both jupyter notebook file in the name of miniprojectbook.ipynb and also .py file in miniproject folder
I have uploaded the notebook without the output because of the longer output it may can get messy so you can always install the mentioned libraries and run the notebook for the output



# Dataset Information

For Data set  GOTO  [https://www.kaggle.com/sudalairajkumar/novel-corona-virus-2019-dataset]

My Data set was upto 29/05/2021



# Prediction Shown for 300 days but the number of days can be changed from the Line of code as shown below

in line of code 

[future=predictModel.make_future_dataframe(periods=300)]

just change the number of periods to your desirable number for change in timePeriod but don't make it too large!
